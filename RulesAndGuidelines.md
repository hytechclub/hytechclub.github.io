# Rules & Guidelines
Be sure to follow all of the rules and guidelines below when participating in Hy-Tech Club.

## Basic Rules
- Attend meetings every week, and email [techoutreach@hyland.com](mailto:techoutreach@hyland.com) to notify us if you will miss a week
- Speak up and let instructors know if they are moving too quickly
- Do not say or do anything you would not do in a school classroom
- If attending virtually, respond to private messages in the Zoom chat
- Pay attention and follow along during the meeting

## Escalation Plan
Your success is our highest priority. If we find that you are struggling, we will do our best to remedy the issue.

- If there is a problem, such as misbehavior or unresponsiveness, we will begin by having a conversation with you during class
- If the issue continues, we will follow up by e-mailing you and your parent/guardian
- If we have any persistent issues, we will reach out to your parent/guardian directly

This plan is not in place to punish you; we just want to do everything you can to make sure you and your fellow students have a positive learning experience.
