# Quiz Games
There are some online quiz games that can be fun!

## Sporcle
Sporcle quizzes are fun because they are collaborative. Every student in the club can shout out answers! For example, the [HTML colors quiz](https://www.sporcle.com/games/rockgolf/rainbow-coalition) is a fun and relevant topic.

## Baamboozle
Baamboozle is a team-based game, so the room could be split into two sides. It can be very unfair, but it can be fun. There are some games like [random trivia](https://www.baamboozle.com/game/751784), or there may be something more relevant.

- [Internet](https://www.baamboozle.com/game/1031111)
- [Abbreviations](https://www.baamboozle.com/game/2282113)
- [Debates](https://www.baamboozle.com/game/2549808)

For debates, split the room and have one side argue one perspective on the debate. Winner can be judged without much thought.

## Gimkit & Blooket (PHONES REQUIRED)
[Gimkit](https://gimkit.com/) and [Blooket](https://blooket.com/) are quiz games that are actual _games_ so they are fun beyond just question answering! They do require devices though. We prefer to keep all activities accessible to those without phones, but there may be some alternatives (loaners, etc).
