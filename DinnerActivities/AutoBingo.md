# Auto Bingo
This is just regular bingo! The only real twist is that instead of a live person calling the squares, it is a website built using HTML and JavaScript.

[Here is the caller](https://hylandtechclub.com/AutoBingo/Caller.html) (code [here](../AutoBingo/Caller.html))

[Here are the printable BINGO boards](./Assets/RandomBingoSheets.pdf) (code [here](../AutoBingo/PrintableRandomBingoBoard.html))

Pass out a bunch of BINGO boards and writing utensils, and the students will follow along. When one gets a BINGO, they win!
