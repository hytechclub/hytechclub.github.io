# Icebreaker Tickets
This is a way for students to interact in some different ways during the first session or two of a club.

Print / cut some copies of all the tickets out, and print a few copies of the rules. Essentially, students complete the tasks on the tickets to earn them. They should collect as many tickets as they can, and the winner can receive a prize.

There are several additional materials required for some of the tickets (e.g., drawing supplies, puzzles, playing cards, origami sheets).

Additionally, candy can be attached to the tickets, so students immediately earn candy after completing the ticket task.
