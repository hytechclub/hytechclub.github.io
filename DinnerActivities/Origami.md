# Origami
This is a fairly straightforward activity! Pass out some origami paper, and some origami instructions (like [this](./Assets/OrigamiCrane.pdf)). Students can fold their paper however they would like. Additional instructions could be provided, or a video could be shown (like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj22vAf15Xc)).
