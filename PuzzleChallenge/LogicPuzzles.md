## Puzzle 1
Jordan always lies on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, but tells the truth on every other day.

Marissa always lies on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, but tells the truth on every other day.

Jordan says: "Yesterday I was lying."
Marissa says: "So was I."

What day is it?

### Answer
Thursday

### Explanation
Because Jordan says he is lying, you know it can only be Monday or Thursday. Because Marissa says she is lying, you know it can only be Thursday or Sunday. Therefore, it must be **Thursday**.

## Puzzle 2
Roger and J decided to play checkers against each other. They bet $1 on each game they played. At the final tally, Roger won three bets total, but J came away with $5. How many games did they play?

### Answer
11

### Explanation
Because J lost 3 bets to Roger, he had lost $3 ($1 per game). So, he had to win back that $3 with three more games, then win another five games to win $5. 3+3+5=**11**.

## Puzzle 3
Allie and Zach stand in front of the classroom, and each one of them is holding a box. One box contains a massive pile of candy, and the other contains one very old piece of Jet's pizza. One instructor always lies, and the other always tells the truth. Each instructor knows the contents of each box, and they also know about the other instructor. You are allowed to ask one yes or no question. What question do you ask to figure out which box contains the candy?

### Answer
Ask Allie: "If I asked Zach if he holds the candy box, would he say 'yes' or 'no'?" (note: You could also flip the instructors)

### Explanation
There are four possible situations to consider:

- Situation 1: Allie is the liar, and she DOES hold the candy box. She would say "yes" because she knows Zach would say "no"
- Situation 2: Allie is the liar, and she does NOT hold the candy box. She would say "no" because she knows Zach would say "yes"
- Situation 3: Allie is the truth-teller, and she DOES hold the candy box. She would say "yes" because she knows Zach would say "yes"
- Situation 4: Allie is the truth-teller, and she does NOT hold the candy box. She would say "no" because she knows Zach would say "no" because she knows Zach would say "no"

So, if Allie says "yes" - you know that she holds the candy box. If Allie says "no" - you know that Zach holds the candy box.

## Puzzle 4
You are caught stealing candy from the candy bowl, and face severe punishment. Ralphie says, "You must give me a statement. If it is true, we will make you watch Bee Movie on repeat for 10 hours. If it is false, we will make you watch Shrek The Third on repeat for 10 hours. If I can't figure it out, you will not have to watch any movies on repeat for 10 hours." What statement can you give to avoid watching a computer-animated comedy from 2007? Note that Ralphie is omniscient.

### Answer
"You will make me watch Shrek The Third on repeat for 10 hours."

### Explanation
If the statement were _false_, that would mean the student would have to watch Shrek The Third on repeat for 10 hours - thus making the statement _true_. If the statement were _true_, that would mean the student would not have to watch Shrek The Third on repeat for 10 hours, making it _false_. It is a **logical paradox**, so Ralphie would not be able to figure it out, thereby allowing the student to roam free.

## Puzzle 5
Caitlin wants people to guess her birthday. She told the month of her birthday to Ehab, and the day of her birthday to Shayne. Then, she showed them a set of dates, and asked Ehab and Shayne which one was her birthday:

> January 5th, January 30th, March 4th, March 5th, March 8th, June 4th, June 7th, September 2nd, September 8th, September 30th

Ehab said, "I don't know your birthday, but I also know that Shayne doesn't know your birthday."

Shayne said, "At first I didn't, but now I do."

Ehab said, "Oh, wait, I know it too now."

What is Caitlin's birthday?

### Answer
January 30th

### Explanation
We start from the full list of dates, and narrow it down. Ehab must not have June or September, because if he did, he would not know for sure that Shayne could not know the answer. June and September each have a unique day that could lead Shayne to the answer. So, because Ehab says "Shayne must not know the birthday," we are left with:

> January 5th, January 30th, March 4th, March 5th, March 8th

Shayne says he knows the answer from this subset, so we know he must have a unique number - not 5. So we are left with:

> January 30th, March 4th, March 8th

Ehab says he knows the answer from this subset, so we know he must have a unique date - not March. So we are left with **January 30th**!
